This project, Moon Tetris, is definitely worth 100 pts. 

Here's why:
We made profound use of canvas tag.
CSS3 features: custom font, text shadow, multiple background images (with permission from Professor Rader).
Cool Javascript libraries: The power of Math!

Mainly we deserve an A because we spent 16+ hours on this project.
And we created tetris, with awesome new moon-physics features.

Difficulties: 
-We tried to get an image to rotate in one spot, but it kept rotating across he screen and no amount of Google
searching was able to fix this issue!
-Rotating tetrimino pieces
-Having tetriminos overlap other pieces
-Clearing a line and then having board shift downwards
-Getting left and right background images to not collide if browser windown decreased
